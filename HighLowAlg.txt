HighLow.py asks the user to guess a random integer between 1 and 100.
The user will be promted to enter a number and the program will tell
the user if it is too low, too high, or correct based on conditions.
The program utilizes a while loop to enforce these conditions.


INPUT:  number (to guess the program's random integer)
OUTPUT: prompts that will tell the user to enter a number,
        tell the user if the number is too high/too low/correct
        the number of turns it took to get the correct number
        will also be displayed

STEPS:
1)  Print the basis of the program/game to the user
2)  Generate a random integer between 1 and 100
3)  Assign each variable and starting number where:
    a) turns = 0
    b) guess = 0
    c) attempt = 1
4)  Set up a while loop
    a)  The program will ask the user to enter a number which will
        equal the variable "guess"
    b)  After every pass through the loop, the number of turns and
        the attempt number will go up by one
    c)  If the guess compares to the value of the correct number,
        then the program will tell the user they are correct and
        tell them how any turns it took them
    d)  If the guess less than the correct number, the program will
        tell the user the number is too low
    e)  If the guess is anything but the other two conditions, the
        program will tell the user the number is too high.
